                                <p>Art galleries are in the business of aesthetics, yet it’s amazing how generic and uninventive many of their websites can be. Minimal graphics, fonts, and color schemes are designed to keep the viewer’s focus on the art itself, often at the expense of creativity and attractiveness.
                                   As in any business, it’s important for galleries to make a website that stands out and is memorable.                                  The websites on this list have achieved that goal by making subtle, yet integral
                                   design choices that, in fact, often increase both functionality and the viewing experience.</p>

                          <p>While many gallery websites take the minimalist approach, the Pace Gallery is not afraid to include elements of color, pattern, and interactive functions in a bulletin-like format.
                             Their web page background images consist of a pale purple number “50,” in celebration of their 50th anniversary in 2010. Without tabs or links to separate sections, instead the gallery’s
                              information is laid out in a series of boxes, with sections on artists, exhibitions, press releases, media, locations, books, news, and about the gallery. Click on an artist and the artists’ box transforms. S
                              elect the option to “expand” and the entire web page layout changes, so that sections where additional information appears are highlighted (perhaps old press releases, books, and the current exhibition), while irrelevant sec
                              tions (maybe media or events) are darkened. It’s a unique system devised so that those looking for information on a specific person or exhibition can avoid skipping from section to section and, 
                              instead, find all the information they need laid out in one place.</p>
